The University of Texas at Arlington Aerodynamics Research Center (ARC) is a facility located in the southeast portion of the campus operated under the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  It was established in 1986 as part of an expansion of UTA's College of Engineering.  The ARC contributes to the vision of UTA and the University of Texas System to transform the university into a full-fledged research institution.  It showcases the aerodynamics research activities at UTA and, in its history, has established itself as a unique facility at a university level.  The wind tunnels and equipment in the facility were mainly built by scouting for and upgrading decommissioned equipment from the government and industry.  Currently, Masters and Ph.D. students perform research in the fields of high-speed gas dynamics, propulsion (including Pulse detonation engines), and Computational fluid dynamics among other projects related to aerodynamics.

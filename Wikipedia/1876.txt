Bending of plates, or plate bending, refers to the deflection of a plate perpendicular to the plane of the plate under the action of external forces and moments.  The amount of deflection can be determined by solving the differential equations of an appropriate plate theory.  The stresses in the plate can be calculated from these deflections.  Once the stresses are known, failure theories can be used to determine whether a plate will fail under a given load.

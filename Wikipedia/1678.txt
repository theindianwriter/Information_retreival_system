In mechanical engineering, Yoshimura buckling is a triangular mesh buckling pattern found in thin-walled cylinders under compression along the axis of the cylinder, producing a corrugated shape resembling the Schwarz lantern. The same pattern can be seen on the sleeves of Mona Lisa.This buckling pattern is named after Yoshimaru Yoshimura, the Japanese researcher who first provided an explanation for its development in a paper first published in Japan in 1951, and later republished in the United States in 1955.The crease pattern for folding the Schwarz lantern from a flat piece of paper, a tessellation of the plane by isosceles triangles, has also been called the Yoshimura pattern based on the same work by Yoshimura.

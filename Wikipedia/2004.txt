The von Kármán wind turbulence model (also known as von Kármán gusts) is a mathematical model of continuous gusts. It matches observed continuous gusts better than that Dryden Wind Turbulence Model and is the preferred model of the United States Department of Defense in most aircraft design and simulation applications. The von Kármán model treats the linear and angular velocity components of continuous gusts as spatially varying stochastic processes and specifies each component's power spectral density. The von Kármán wind turbulence model is characterized by irrational power spectral densities, so filters can be designed that take white noise inputs and output stochastic processes with the approximated von Kármán gusts' power spectral densities.

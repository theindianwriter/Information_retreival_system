DragonflyTV is a science education television series produced by Twin Cities Public Television. The show aired on PBS Kids from 2002 to 2008, with reruns until 2009 on selected stations. Seasons 1–4 were co-hosted by Michael Brandon Battle and Mariko Nakasone. Seasons 5–7 were hosted by Eric Artell and are produced in partnership with science museums. DragonflyTV was created in collaboration with Project Dragonfly at Miami University, which founded Dragonfly magazine, the first national magazine to feature children's investigations and discoveries. DragonflyTV pioneered a "real kids, real science" approach to children's science television and led to the development of the award-winning SciGirls television series. Reruns of DragonflyTV air in off-network syndication to allow commercial stations to meet federal E/I mandates.

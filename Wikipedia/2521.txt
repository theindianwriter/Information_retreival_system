Vault structuring is a forming technology to generate three-dimensional rectangular or hexagonal structures in thin-walled materials such as sheet metal, plastic sheeting, cardboard and paper. 
It distinguishes itself from conventional sheet metal forming processes (such as embossing, beading and hydroforming) by allowing a self-organized structuring with minimal energy consumption during the forming process, which particularly offers material and energy savings. The main advantage is an increased rigidity (bending- and bulge rigidity) of vault structured materials compared to unstructured materials.
Vault structured materials are products of Dr. Mirtsch GmbH and protected by numerous national and international patents.

In mathematical optimization, the Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960, which is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is also known as Rosenbrock's valley or Rosenbrock's banana function.
The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global minimum, however, is difficult.
The function is defined by

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        (
        a
        −
        x
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        +
        b
        (
        y
        −
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x,y)=(a-x)^{2}+b(y-x^{2})^{2}}
  
It has a global minimum at 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        (
        a
        ,
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)=(a,a^{2})}
  , where 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x,y)=0}
  . Usually these parameters are set such that 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=1}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        =
        100
      
    
    {\displaystyle b=100}
  . Only in the trivial case where 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=0}
   the function is symmetric and the minimum is at the origin.

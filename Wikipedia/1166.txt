An axial fan is a type of fan that causes gas to flow through it in an axial direction, parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. The flow is axial at entry and exit. The fan is designed to produce a pressure difference, and hence force, to cause a flow through the fan. Factors which determine the performance of the fan include the number and shape of the blades. Fans have many applications including in wind tunnels and cooling towers. Design parameters include power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.Axial fans generally comprise fewer blades (two to six) than ducted fans. Axial fans commonly have larger radius and lower speed (Ï‰) than ducted fans (esp. at similar power. Stress proportional to r^2).

Georgios B. Giannakis (born February 27, 1958) is a Greekâ€“American Professor, engineer, and inventor. He has been an Endowed Chair Professor of Wireless Telecommunications, he was Director of the Digital Technology Center, and at present he is a McKnight Presidential Chair with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota.
Giannakis is internationally known for his work in the areas of statistical signal processing, distributed estimation using sensor networks, wireless communications and cross-layer network designs, on topics such as auto-regressive moving average system identification using higher-order statistics, principal component filter banks, linear precoding, multicarrier modulation, ultra-wideband communications, cognitive radios, and smart grids.  Seminal work includes the development of linear precoding wireless communication systems, which provided a unified approach for designing space-time block codes that achieve data high rates and reliability, and proposal of zero-padding as an alternative to the cyclic prefix for multi-carrier communication systems, which had impact in the multi-band ultra wide band standard. Current research focuses on big data, graph learning, and network science with applications to social, brain and power networks with renewables.
Giannakis has left a substantial academic legacy as an advisor of more than 54 Ph.D. dissertations and mentor of more than 26 postdoctoral researchers at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota.

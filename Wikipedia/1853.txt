In numerical linear algebra, the Arnoldi iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm and an important example of an iterative method.  Arnoldi finds an approximation to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general (possibly non-Hermitian) matrices by constructing an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, which makes it particularly useful when dealing with large sparse matrices.
The Arnoldi method belongs to a class of linear algebra algorithms that give a partial result after a small number of iterations, in contrast to so-called direct methods which must complete to give any useful results (see for example, Householder transformation). The partial result in this case being the first few vectors of the basis the algorithm is building.
When applied to Hermitian matrices it reduces to the Lanczos algorithm.  The Arnoldi iteration was invented by W. E. Arnoldi in 1951.

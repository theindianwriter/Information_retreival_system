Microcracks in rock, also known as microfractures and cracks, are spaces in rock with the longest length of 1000 μm and the other two dimensions of 10 μm. In general, the ratio of width to length of microcracks is between 10−3 to 10−5.Due to the scale, microcracks are observed using microscope to obtain their basic characteristics. Microcrack formation provides insights into the strength and deformation behavior of rocks. Experimental and numerical results both play an important role in studying microcracks, especially their kinematics and dynamics. Microcracks in rock have been studied to understand geologic problems such as the early stage of earthquakes and fault formation. In engineering, microcracks in rock have been linked to underground engineering problems, such as deep geological repository.

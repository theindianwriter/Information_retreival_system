Mark Zachary Jacobson (born 1965) is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere/Energy Program.  Jacobson has developed computer models to study the effects of fossil fuel and biomass burning on air pollution, weather, and climate.
Jacobsonâ€™s career has focused on better understanding air pollution and global warming problems and developing large-scale clean, renewable energy solutions to them. In 2009 Jacobson and Mark Delucchi published a paper in Scientific American proposing that the world should move to 100% renewable energy, namely wind, water, and solar power, in all energy sectors. He has traveled extensively granting interviews, promoting and discussing  "the development of technical and economic plans to convert the energy infrastructure of each of the 50 United States to those powered by 100% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes".Jacobson has built his own net-zero home to run on renewable energy.In 2017, Christopher Clack, Ken Caldeira, and 19 other researchers challenged the findings of a followup 2015 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In response, Jacobson filed, and later withdrew, a libel lawsuit against publisher PNAS, demanding retraction and $10 million in damages. In 2020 the court ordered Jacobson to pay the legal fees of Clack and PNAS; the amount to be paid has not been finalized.

The Seawind is a family of composite, four-seat, amphibian airplanes that all feature a single tail-mounted engine. They have been produced as kits and were at one time under development to be sold as completed aircraft.
The Seawind design originated in Canada, where the prototype], flew for the first time on 23 August 1982. Later development and production was carried out by Seawind International of Haliburton, Ontario, Canada, before the rights were acquired by SNA and production moved to Kimberton, Pennsylvania, United States. The major production versions of the Seawind line consist of the kit-built Seawind 2000 and Seawind 3000 and the Seawind 300C that was under development by Seawind LLC, also of Kimberton, Pennsylvania. The Seawind 3000 was introduced in 1993.
Production of Seawind 3000 kits was suspended in 2002 to concentrate on certification of the 300C and the kits are no longer available.The Seawind 300C was intended to be the certified production version, derived from the kit-built Seawind 3000. It incorporated many changes required to conform to the certification standards. The company indicated that certification flight testing would continue after the crash of the prototype on August 16, 2007, but did not actually resume until early 2010. Certification flight testing continued through the summer and autumn of 2011, but by the end of 2020 the company website had been taken down and the company seems to have ceased business.

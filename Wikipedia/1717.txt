Carbon nanotube metal matrix composites (CNT-MMC) are an emerging class of new materials that are being developed to take advantage of the high tensile strength and electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube materials. Critical to the realization of CNT-MMC possessing optimal properties in these areas are the development of synthetic techniques that are (a) economically producible, (b) provide for a homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in the metallic matrix, and (c) lead to strong interfacial adhesion between the metallic matrix and the carbon nanotubes. Since the development of CNT-MMC is still in the research phase, the current focus is primarily on improving these latter two areas.

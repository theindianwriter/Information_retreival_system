The Canadair CL-84 "Dynavert", designated by the Canadian Forces as the CX-131, was a V/STOL turbine tiltwing monoplane designed and manufactured by Canadair between 1964 and 1972. Only four of these experimental aircraft were built with three entering flight testing. Two of the CL-84s crashed due to mechanical failures, with no fatalities occurring in either of the accidents.  Despite the fact that the CL-84 was successful in the experimental and operational trials carried out between 1972 and 1974, none of the prospective customers placed any orders for the type.

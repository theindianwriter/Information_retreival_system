A compressor map is a chart which shows the performance of a turbomachinery compressor. This type of compressor is used in gas turbine engines, for supercharging reciprocating engines and for industrial processes, where it is known as a dynamic compressor. A map is created from compressor rig test results or predicted by a special computer program. Alternatively the map of a similar compressor can be suitably scaled. This article is an overview of compressor maps and their different applications and also has detailed explanations of maps for a fan and intermediate and high-pressure compressors from a three-shaft aero-engine as specific examples.
Compressor maps are an integral part of predicting the performance of gas turbine and turbocharged engines, both at design and off-design conditions. They also serve a critical purpose in selecting the correct compressors for industrial processes. 
Fans and turbines also have operating maps, although the latter are significantly different in appearance to that of compressors.

In geology, numerical modeling is a widely applied technique to tackle complex geological problems by computational simulation of geological scenarios.
Numerical modeling uses mathematical models to describe the physical conditions of geological scenarios using numbers and equations. Nevertheless, some of their equations are difficult to solve directly, such as partial differential equations. With numerical models, geologists can use methods, such as finite difference methods, to approximate the solutions of these equations. Numerical experiments can then be performed in these models, yielding the results that can be interpreted in the context of geological process. Both qualitative and quantitative understanding of a variety of geological processes can be developed via these experiments.Numerical modelling has been used to assist in the study of rock mechanics, thermal history of rocks, movements of tectonic plates and the Earth's mantle. Flow of fluids is simulated using numerical methods, and this shows how ground water moves, or how motions of the molten outer core yields the geomagnetic field.

In aeroacoustics, jet noise is the field that focuses on the noise generation caused by high-velocity jets and the turbulent eddies generated by shearing flow. Such noise is known as broadband noise and extends well beyond the range of human hearing (100 kHz and higher).  Jet noise is also responsible for some of the loudest sounds ever produced by mankind.

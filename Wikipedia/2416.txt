A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through a continuous range of gear ratios. This contrasts with other transmissions that provide a limited number of gear ratios in fixed steps. The flexibility of a CVT with suitable control may allow the engine to operate at a constant RPM while the vehicle moves at varying speeds.
CVTs are used in automobiles, tractors, motor scooters, snowmobiles, and earthmoving equipment.
The most common type of CVT uses two pulleys connected by a belt or chain, however, several other designs have also been used at times.

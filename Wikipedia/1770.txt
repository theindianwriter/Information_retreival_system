Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a laboratory technique used in geology and material science to measure fundamental material properties involving elasticity. This technique relies on the fact that solid objects have natural frequencies at which they vibrate when mechanically excited. The natural frequency depends on the elasticity, size, and shape of the objectâ€”RUS exploits this property of solids to determine the elastic tensor of the material. The great advantage of this technique is that the entire elastic tensor is obtained from a single crystal sample in a single rapid measurement. At lower or more general frequencies, this method is known as acoustic resonance spectroscopy.

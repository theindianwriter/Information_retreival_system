Internal combustion engine cooling uses either air or  liquid to remove the waste heat from an internal combustion engine. For small or special purpose engines, cooling using air from the atmosphere makes for a lightweight and relatively simple system.  Watercraft can use water directly from the surrounding environment to cool their engines.  For water-cooled engines on aircraft and surface vehicles, waste heat is transferred from a closed loop of water pumped through the engine to the surrounding atmosphere by a radiator.
Water has a higher heat capacity than air, and can thus move heat more quickly away from the engine, but a radiator and pumping system add weight, complexity, and cost.  Higher-power engines generate more waste heat, but can move more weight, meaning they are generally water-cooled.  Radial engines allow air to flow around each cylinder directly, giving them an advantage for air cooling over straight engines, flat engines, and V engines.  Rotary engines have a similar configuration, but the cylinders also continually rotate, creating an air flow even when the vehicle is stationary.
Aircraft design more strongly favors lower weight and air-cooled designs.  Rotary engines were popular on aircraft until the end of World War I, but had serious stability and efficiency problems.  Radial engines were popular until the end of World War II, until gas turbine engines largely replaced them.  Modern propeller-driven aircraft with internal-combustion engines are still largely air-cooled.  Modern cars generally favor power over weight, and typically have water-cooled engines.  Modern motorcycles are lighter than cars, and both cooling fluids are common. Some sport motorcycles were cooled with both air and oil (sprayed underneath the piston heads).

High Strain Composite Structures (HSC Structures) are a class of composite material structures designed to perform in a high deformation setting.  High strain composite structures transition from one shape to another upon the application of external forces.  A single HSC Structure component is designed to transition between at least two, but often more, dramatically different shapes.  At least one of the shapes is designed to function as a structure which can support external loads.
High strain composite structures usually consist of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), which are designed to undergo relatively high material strain levels under the course of normal operating conditions in comparison to most FRP structural applications.  FRP materials are anisotropic and highly tailor-able which allows for unique effects upon deformation.  As a result, many HSC Structures are configured to possess one or more stable states (shapes at which the structure will remain without external constraints) which are tuned for a particular application.  HSC Structures with multiple stable states can also be classified as bi-stable structures.
HSC Structures are most often used in applications where low weight structures are desired that can also be stowed in a small volume.  Flexible composite structures are used within the aerospace industry for deployable mechanisms such antennas or solar arrays on spacecraft.  Other applications focus on materials or structures in which multiple stable configurations are required.

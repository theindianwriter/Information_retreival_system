The Aerion AS2 was a proposed supersonic business jet that was being developed by Aerion Corporation.
In May 2014, it was announced that the Aerion AS2 would be part of a larger Aerion SBJ redesign, which aimed for release after a seven-year developmental period.
Aerion partnered with Airbus in September the same year.
In December 2017, Airbus was replaced by Lockheed Martin.
Its General Electric Affinity engine was unveiled in October 2018.
In February 2019, Boeing replaced Lockheed Martin.
Development stopped when Aerion ceased operations in May 2021.
The Aerion AS2 12-passenger aircraft aimed for Mach 1.6 with a supersonic natural laminar flow wing for a minimum projected range of 4,750 nm (8,800 km). 
A $4 billion development cost was anticipated, for a market of 300 over 10 years and 500 overall for $120 million each.

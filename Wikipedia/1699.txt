A stabilator, more frequently all-moving tail or all-flying tail, is a fully movable aircraft stabilizer. It serves the usual functions of longitudinal stability, control and stick force requirements   otherwise performed by the separate parts of a conventional horizontal stabilizer and elevator. Apart from a higher efficiency at high Mach number, it is a useful device for changing the aircraft balance within wide limits, and for mastering the stick forces.Stabilator (a portmanteau of "stabilizer-elevator") is also known in aircraft terminology as an all-moving tailplane, all-movable tail(plane), all-moving stabilizer, all-flying tail(plane), full-flying stabilizer, flying tail and slab tailplane.

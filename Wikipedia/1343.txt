While almost every weighing scale uses the same basic principle (the gravitational force exerted by an object divided by the area the force is applied on), industrial weighing scales are designed to do a lot more. They handle heavier loads, often in different conditions, both environmental and physical.
The terminology applied to different industrial weighing systems is widely ranged, with some terms adapted specifically for them, which are included in this glossary.  Modern scales are electronic, and often computer-networked; consequently, the field has imported a fair amount of terminology from electrical engineering and computerized data transfer.

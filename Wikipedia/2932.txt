High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) is a type of shaped charge explosive that uses the Munroe effect to penetrate heavy armor. The warhead functions by having an explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity superplastic jet; this superplastic jet is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD). The jet's effect is purely kinetic in nature; the round has no explosive or incendiary effect on the target.
Because they rely for their penetration performance on the chemical energy in the warhead rather than on the kinetic energy of the entire round, HEAT warheads do not have to be delivered with high velocity, as an armor-piercing round does. Thus they generate less recoil.
The HEAT warhead has become less effective against tanks and other armored vehicles due to the use of composite armor, explosive-reactive armor, and active-protection systems which destroy the HEAT warhead before it functions. While unitary HEAT warheads may pose little threat to any modern tank, they are still deadly against lighter vehicles and aircraft, and multiple warheads can be combined in a tandem configuration to defeat some advanced armors.
Contrary to a common misunderstanding of their name, the performance of HEAT weapons has nothing to do with thermal effects.

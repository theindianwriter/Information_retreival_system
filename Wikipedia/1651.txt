The rivi√®re de la Roche Plate (English: flat rock river) is a tributary of the Bras du Nord, flowing in the territory of the municipality of Saint-Raymond, in the MRC Portneuf Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in Quebec, Canada. The upper part of this river flows into the western part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
The lower part of the Roche Plate river valley is mainly served by the rang Saguenay road which first goes up to the north and branches off to the west to serve the north shore of the Bras du Nord including the hamlet Pine Lake. Another secondary forest road goes up this small valley.Forestry is the main economic activity in this sector; recreotourism activities, second.The surface of the Roche Plate River (except the rapids) is generally frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, but the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.

In continuum mechanics,  plate theories are mathematical descriptions of the mechanics of flat plates that draws on the theory of beams.  Plates are defined as plane structural elements with a small thickness compared to the planar dimensions.  The typical thickness to width ratio of a plate structure is less than 0.1.  A plate theory takes advantage of this disparity in length scale to reduce the full three-dimensional solid mechanics problem to a two-dimensional problem.  The aim of plate theory is to calculate the deformation and stresses in a plate subjected to loads.
Of the numerous plate theories that have been developed since the late 19th century, two are widely accepted and used in engineering. These are

the Kirchhoffâ€“Love theory of plates (classical plate theory)
The Uflyand-Mindlin theory of plates (first-order shear plate theory)

A building undergoes progressive collapse when a primary structural element fails, resulting in the failure of adjoining structural elements, which in turn causes further structural failure.Progressive collapses may be accidental, due to design deficiencies, fire, unintentional overload, material failure or natural phenomenon (e.g. erosion, wind or earthquakes).  They can also be induced deliberately as a demolition method - specifically building implosion.  They may also be caused by acts of terrorism or war.

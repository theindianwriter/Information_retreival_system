The West Burton power stations are a pair of power stations on the River Trent near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire,  England. One is a coal-fired power station, which was commissioned in 1966, and the second is a combined cycle gas turbine power station, commissioned in 2013. Both stations are owned and operated by EDF Energy. 
The station has been accredited as an Investor in People since 1995 and ISO accredited (ISO 14001) for its environmental management system since 1996. The power station won a RoSPA President's Award in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The site is the furthest north of what was a series of power stations in the Trent valley, being 3.5 miles (5.6 km) downstream of the now-closed Cottam power stations. The power station is one of three coal-fired generators left in England and is expected to close before 2025, with all generation to cease on 30 September 2022.

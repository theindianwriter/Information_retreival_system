The Tiger-class cruisers were a group of three post-Second World War cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were the last all-gun cruisers completed for the Royal Navy. The three ships came from an order of eight Minotaur-class cruisers ordered in 1941â€“2, work on the second group of three ships being effectively suspended in mid-1944. The cruisers were finally completed to a changed design, after a very long delay, entering service in the 1960s as the Tiger-class.
Amid cancellations of warship production due to necessary post-war austerity the three hulls were available but construction was delayed by both the Korean War and the Suez Crisis. By the time final approval was given to complete them as anti-aircraft cruisers in November 1954, both the hulls and machinery were out of date. The Royal Navy's first ships with guided missiles, the County-class destroyers, were ordered less than two years later and entered service only four years after HMS Tiger.
In 1964 the Tigers were approved for conversion into helicopter-carrying cruisers. Their intended purpose then changed from carrying four Westland Wessex helicopters for amphibious operations to four Westland Sea King helicopters for anti-submarine work. The conversion of HMS Blake and Tiger carried out between 1965 and 1972 proved much more expensive and difficult than was anticipated and the conversion of Lion was cancelled as a result.
Lion was scrapped in 1975, having already been used as a source of spares for her sisters. With limited manpower, limited resources, and better ships available  the Tiger and Blake were decommissioned in the late 1970s and placed in reserve.
When the Falklands War broke out in 1982, consideration was given to returning both ships to service but work to refurbishing was cancelled as it would not have been finished before the end of hostilities. Blake was scrapped in 1982 and Tiger in 1986.

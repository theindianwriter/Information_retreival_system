Inlet cones (sometimes called shock cones or inlet centerbodies) are a component of some supersonic aircraft and missiles.  They are primarily used on ramjets, such as the D-21 Tagboard and Lockheed X-7.  Some turbojet aircraft including the Su-7, MiG-21, English Electric Lightning, and SR-71 also use an inlet cone.

A griddle is a cooking device consisting of a broad flat surface heated by gas, electricity, wood, or coal, with both residential and commercial applications. In industrialized countries, a griddle is most commonly a flat metal plate, elsewhere typically a brick slab or tablet.A residential griddle may be composed of chrome steel, aluminum, cast iron, or carbon steel. The vast majority of commercial grade griddles are made from A36 steel, though some are stainless steel or composites of stainless and aluminium. Almost all residential and commercial griddles are heated directly or indirectly by flame or electrical elements.

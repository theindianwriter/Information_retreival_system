The Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 is a high-bypass turbofan engine produced by Rolls-Royce plc, one of the two engine options for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, competing with the General Electric GEnx.
It first ran on 14 February 2006 and first flew on 18 June 2007 before a joint EASA/FAA certification on 7 August 2007 and entered service on 26 October 2011.
Corrosion-related fatigue cracking of intermediate pressure (IP) turbine blades was discovered in early 2016, grounding up to 44 aircraft and costing Rolls-Royce at least £1.354 billion.
The 62,264–81,028 lbf (276.96–360.43 kN) engine has a bypass ratio over 10:1, a 2.85 m (9 ft 4 in) m fan and keeps the characteristic three-spool layout of the Trent series.
The updated Trent 1000 TEN with technology from the Trent XWB and the Advance3 aims for up to 3% better fuel burn. It first ran in mid-2014, was EASA certified in July 2016, first flew on a 787 on 7 December 2016 and was introduced on 23 November 2017.
By early 2018 it had a 38% market share of the decided order book.
The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 is a version with bleed air used for the Airbus A330neo.

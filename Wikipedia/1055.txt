In fluid mechanics, two-phase flow is a flow of gas and liquid â€” a particular example of multiphase flow.  Two-phase flow can occur in various forms, such as flows transitioning from pure liquid to vapor as a result of external heating, separated flows, and dispersed two-phase flows where one phase is present in the form of particles, droplets, or bubbles in a continuous carrier phase (i.e. gas or liquid).

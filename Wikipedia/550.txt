In fluid dynamics, the process of a laminar flow becoming turbulent is known as laminar–turbulent transition. The main parameter characterizing transition is the Reynolds number.
Transition is often described as a process proceeding through a series of stages.  "Transitional flow" can refer to transition in either direction, that is laminar–turbulent transitional or turbulent–laminar transitional flow.
The process applies to any fluid flow, and is most often used in the context of boundary layers.

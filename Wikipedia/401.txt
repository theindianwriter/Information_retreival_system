Shear velocity, also called friction velocity, is a form by which a shear stress may be re-written in units of velocity. It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow.
Shear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe:

Diffusion and dispersion of particles, tracers, and contaminants in fluid flows
The velocity profile near the boundary of a flow (see Law of the wall)
Transport of sediment in a channelShear velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. Shear velocity scales well to rates of dispersion and bedload sediment transport. A general rule is that the shear velocity is between 5% to 10% of the mean flow velocity.
For river base case, the shear velocity can be calculated by Manning's equation.

  n is the Gauckler–Manning coefficient. Units for values of n are often left off, however it is not dimensionless, having units of: (T/[L1/3]; s/[ft1/3]; s/[m1/3]).
Rh is the hydraulic radius (L; ft, m);
the role of a is a dimension correction factor. Thus a= 1 m1/3/s = 1.49 ft1/3/s.Instead of finding

  where τ is the shear stress in an arbitrary layer of fluid and ρ is the density of the fluid.
Typically, for sediment transport applications, the shear velocity is evaluated at the lower boundary of an open channel:

  
    
      
        
          u
          
            ⋆

    {\displaystyle u_{\star }={\sqrt {\frac {\tau _{b}}{\rho }}}}
  where τb is the shear stress given at the boundary.
Shear velocity can also be defined in terms of the local velocity and shear stress fields (as opposed to whole-channel values, as given above).

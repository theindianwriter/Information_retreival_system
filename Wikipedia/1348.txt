Tektites (from Greek τηκτός tēktós, "molten") are gravel-sized bodies composed of black, green, brown, or gray natural glass formed from terrestrial debris ejected during meteorite impacts. The term was coined by Austrian geologist Franz Eduard Suess (1867–1941), son of Eduard Suess. They generally range in size from millimeters to centimeters. Millimeter-scale tektites are known as microtektites.Tektites are characterized by:

a fairly homogeneous composition
an extremely low content of water and other volatiles
an abundance of lechatelierite
a general lack of microscopic crystals known as microlites and chemical relation to the local bedrock or local sediments
their distribution within geographically extensive strewn fields

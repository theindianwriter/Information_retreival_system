The Tesla turbine is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913.  It is referred to as a bladeless turbine. The Tesla turbine is also known as the  boundary-layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl) because it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Bioengineering researchers have referred to it as a multiple-disk centrifugal pump.  One of Tesla's desires for implementation of this turbine was for geothermal power, which was described in Our Future Motive Power.

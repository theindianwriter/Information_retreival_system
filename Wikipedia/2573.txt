Metal expansion joints (also called compensators) are compensating elements for thermal expansion and relative movement in pipelines, containers and machines. They consist of one or more metal bellows, connectors at both ends, and tie rods that depend on the application. They are differentiated according to the three basic types of movement: axial, angular and lateral expansion joints. Expansion joints have usage in various sectors, like energy productions, paper industry, chemical industry, water treatment, oil and gas. Everywhere where exist pipelines and occurs thermal movements or vibration, then expansion joints can be used.

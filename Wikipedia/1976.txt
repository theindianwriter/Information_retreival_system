Vortex Bladeless Ltd. is a Spanish technology startup company that is developing a type of wind power generator which extracts energy from wind with no rotation, blades, shafts, gears, or lubricants, unlike wind turbines. It is based on the phenomena of aeroelasticity and resonance, termed aeroelastic resonance, harnessing energy from the wind on the emission of Theodore von K치rm치n's vortexes. This process is called vortex shedding or K치rm치n vortex street, and is a common problem for aeronautics and some architecture. This phenomenon allows the Vortex generator to oscillate with small movements.This technology has some traits which are more similar to solar power than to wind turbines, such as being better suited to autonomous operation and distributed generation of energy off the grid, for and on low-power systems.

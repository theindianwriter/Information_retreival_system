Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is a powerful mathematical approach to simplify the process of finding stationary points for a described functional by taking an advantage of small parameters. VAM is the synergy of variational principles and asymptotic approaches, variational principles are applied to the defined functional as well as the asymptotes are applied to the same functional instead of applying on differential equations due to its less prone to errors. This methodology is applicable for whole range of physics problems, where the problem has to be defined in a variational form and should be able to identify the small parameters within the problem definition.
In other words, VAM can be applicable where the functional is so complex in determining the stationary points either by analytical or by computationally expensive numerical analysis with an advantage of small parameters. Thus, approximate stationary points in the functional can be utilized to obtain the original functional.

A signal-flow graph or signal-flowgraph (SFG), invented by Claude Shannon, but often called a Mason graph after Samuel Jefferson Mason who coined the term, is a specialized flow graph, a directed graph in which nodes represent system variables, and branches (edges, arcs, or arrows) represent functional connections between pairs of nodes. Thus, signal-flow graph theory builds on that of directed graphs (also called digraphs), which includes as well that of oriented graphs. This mathematical theory of digraphs exists, of course, quite apart from its applications.SFGs are most commonly used to represent signal flow in a physical system and its controller(s), forming a cyber-physical system.  Among their other uses are the representation of signal flow in various electronic networks and amplifiers, digital filters, state-variable filters and some other types of analog filters.  In nearly all literature, a signal-flow graph is associated with a set of linear equations.

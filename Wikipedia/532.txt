A vortex ring, also called a toroidal vortex, is a torus-shaped vortex in a fluid or gas; that is, a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop.  The dominant flow in a vortex ring is said to be toroidal, more precisely poloidal.Vortex rings are plentiful in turbulent flows of liquids and gases, but are rarely noticed unless the motion of the fluid is revealed by suspended particlesâ€”as in the smoke rings which are often produced intentionally or accidentally by smokers.  Fiery vortex rings are also a commonly produced trick by fire eaters.  Visible vortex rings can also be formed by the firing of certain artillery, in mushroom clouds, and in microbursts.A vortex ring usually tends to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring and such that the inner edge of the ring moves faster forward than the outer edge.  Within a stationary body of fluid, a vortex ring can travel for relatively long distance, carrying the spinning fluid with it.

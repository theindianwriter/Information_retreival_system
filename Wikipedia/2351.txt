Structural elements are used in structural analysis to split a complex structure into simple elements. Within a structure, an element cannot be broken down (decomposed) into parts of different kinds (e.g., beam or column).Structural elements can be lines, surfaces or volumes.Line elements:

Rod - axial loads
Beam - axial and bending loads
Struts or Compression members- compressive loads
Ties, Tie rods, eyebars, guy-wires, suspension cables, or wire ropes - tension loadsSurface elements:

membrane - in-plane loads only
shell - in plane and bending moments
Concrete slab
deck
shear panel - shear loads onlyVolumes:

Axial, shear and bending loads for all three dimensions

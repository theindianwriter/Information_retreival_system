The General Electric Passport is a turbofan developed by GE Aviation for large business jets.
It was selected in 2010 to power the Bombardier Global 7500/8000, first ran on June 24, 2013 and first flew in 2015.
It was certified in April 2016 and powered the Global 7500 first flight on November 4, 2016, before its 2018 introduction.
It produces 14,000 to 20,000 lbf (62 to 89 kN) of thrust, a range previously covered by the General Electric CF34.
A smaller scaled CFM LEAP, it is a twin-spool axial engine with a 5.6:1 bypass ratio and a 45:1 overall pressure ratio and is noted for its large one-piece 52 in (130 cm) fan 18-blade titanium blisk.

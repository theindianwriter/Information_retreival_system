The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) formerly known as Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay is India's premier nuclear research facility, headquartered in Trombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra. Founded by Homi Jehangir Bhabha Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) in January 1954 as a multidisciplinary research program essential for the 
india's nuclear program. It operates under the Department of Atomic Energy(DAE) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India. In 1966 after the death of Homi Jehangir Bhabha AEET renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) BARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, chemical engineering, material sciences & metallurgy, electronic instrumentation, biology and medicine, supercomputing, high-energy physics and Plasma physics  and associated research for Indian nuclear programme and related areas.
BARC's core mandate is to sustain peaceful applications of nuclear energy. It manages all facets of nuclear power generation, from the theoretical design of reactors to, computer modeling and simulation, risk analysis, development and testing of new reactor fuel,  materials, etc. It also researches spent fuel processing and safe disposal of nuclear waste. Its other research focus areas are applications for isotopes in industries, Radiation Technologies and their application to health, food and medicine, agriculture and environment, accelerator and Laser Technology, electronics, instrumentation and reactor control and Material Science, environment and radiation monitoring etc. BARC operates a number of research reactors across the country.Its primary facilities are in Trombay, new facilities are coming up in challakere located in chitradurga district in Karnataka along with Special Mineral Enrichment Facility which focuses on enrichment of uranium fuel and in Atchutapuram near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh for supporting India's nuclear submarine program and produce high specific activity radioisotopes for extensive research.

The Citroën CX is a large, front-engined, front-wheel-drive executive car manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1974 to 1991.  Production models took the form of a four-door fastback sedan, station wagon (estate), and a long-wheelbase fastback limousine.  The CX is known for its hydropneumatic self-leveling suspension system, and its low coefficient of drag, underscored by its nameplate CX, which references the aerodynamics symbol

Voted the 1975 European Car of the Year, the CX has been described by some enthusiasts as the last "real Citroën" before Peugeot took control of the company in 1976.  The CX was also the final successful model of the "big Citroën" era, dating back to 1934.

Mangler transformation, also known as Mangler-Stepanov transformation (Stepanov 1947, Mangler 1948, Schlichting 1955),
reduces the axisymmetric  boundary layer equations to the plane boundary layer equations.
The transformation transforms the equations of axisymmetric boundary layer with external velocity 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   in terms of original variables

A mathematical model is a description of a  system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science). Mathematical models are also used in music, linguistics,philosophy (for example, intensively in analytic philosophy), and religion (for example, the recurring uses of the #7, 12 & 40 in the Bible).
A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behavior.

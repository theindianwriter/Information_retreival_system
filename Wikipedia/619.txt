Nova is an American science documentary television series produced by WGBH Boston for PBS. Many of the programs in this list were not originally produced for PBS, but were acquired from other sources such as the BBC. All acquired programs are edited for Nova, if only to provide American English narration and additional voice of interpreters (translating from another language).
Most of the episodes aired in a 60-minute time slot.In 2005, Nova began airing some episodes titled NOVA scienceNOW, which followed a newsmagazine style format. For two seasons, NOVA scienceNOW episodes aired in the same time slot as Nova. In 2008, NOVA scienceNOW was officially declared its own series and given its own time slot. Therefore, NOVA scienceNOW episodes are not included in this list.

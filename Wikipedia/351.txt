Raptor is a family of full-flow staged combustion cycle rocket engines developed and manufactured by SpaceX, for use on the in-development Starship fully reusable launch vehicle. The engine is powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in SpaceX's prior Merlin and Kestrel rocket engines. The Raptor engine has more than twice the thrust of SpaceX's Merlin engine that powers their current Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.
Raptor will be used in both stages of the two-stage-to-orbit, super-heavy-lift Starship system launch vehicle, which will supersede Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. Starship will be used in various applications, including Earth-orbit satellite delivery, deployment of a large portion of SpaceX's own Starlink megaconstellation, and the exploration and colonization of Mars.The Raptor engine first flew on the Starhopper test vehicle in July 2019 and became the first full-flow staged combustion rocket engine ever flown. As of August 2020, Raptor holds the record for the highest combustion chamber pressure ever reached by an operational rocket engine, at 330 bar (33 MPa; 4,800 psi), surpassing the record held by the RD-701 rocket engine at 300 bar (30 MPa; 4,400 psi).

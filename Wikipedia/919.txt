Human factors in diving equipment design is the influence of the interaction between the diver and the equipment on the design of the equipment. The underwater diver relies on various items of diving and support equipment to stay alive and in reasonable comfort and to perform the planned tasks during a dive. The design of the equipment can strongly influence its effectiveness in performing the desired functions.
Divers vary considerably in anthropometric dimensions, physical strength, joint flexibility, etc. Diving equipment should allow as full a range of function as reasonably practicable and should be matched to the diver, the environment and the task. The interface between equipment and diver can strongly influence functionality. Diving support equipment is usually shared by a wide range of divers, and must work for them all. 
The most difficult stages of a dive for recreational divers are out of water activities and transitions between water and the surface site such as carrying equipment on shore, exiting from water to boat and shore, surface swimming, and dressing into the equipment. Safety and reliability, adjustability to fit the individual, performance, and simplicity were rated the most important features for diving equipment by recreational divers.The professional diver is supported by a surface team, who are available to assist with the out-of-water activities to the extent necessary to reduce the risk associated with them to a level acceptable in terms of the governing regulations and codes of practice. This tends to make professional diving more expensive, and the cost tends to be passed onto the client.

The Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) connects habitable elements in the US Orbital Segment (USOS) of the International Space Station (ISS).  The CBM has two distinct sides that, once mated, form a cylindrical vestibule between modules.  The vestibule is about 16 inches (0.4 m) long and 6 feet (1.8 m) across.  At least one end of the vestibule is often limited in diameter by a smaller bulkhead penetration.
The elements are maneuvered to the berthing-ready position by a Remote Manipulator System (RMS). Latches and bolts on the Active CBM (ACBM) side pull fittings and floating nuts on the Passive CBM (PCBM) side to align and join the two.
After the vestibule is pressurized, crew members clear a passage between modules by removing some CBM components. Utility connectors are installed between facing bulkheads, with a closeout panel to cover them.  The resulting tunnel can be used as a loading bay, admitting large payloads from visiting cargo spacecraft that would not fit through a typical personnel passageway.

A muzzle shroud, linear compensator, blast shield, forward blast diverter or concussion reduction device (CRD) is a sleeve (either circular or otherwise) that attaches to and extends beyond the muzzle of a firearm to redirect some of the noise and concussion (shock wave) from the muzzle blast forward and away from the shooter and other bystanders behind and to the sides.A muzzle shroud is similar to a barrel shroud with the difference that it only surrounds the far end of the barrel (muzzle). It can be a muzzle extension or muzzle device, and can also be considered a flash suppressor without circumferential openings.
A muzzle shroud differs from a silencer (sound suppressor) in that its primary function is not to suppress the sound, but merely redirect it so to increase the comfort of the shooter, reducing the concussion to a comfortable level.Linear compensators are also a form of muzzle shrouds. While most muzzle brakes redirect the gases to the side and rearward, most linear compensators redirect the gases forward. Linear compensators and suppressors do not have the disadvantages of a redirected muzzle blast; they actually reduce the blast by venting high pressure gas forward at reduced velocity
A muzzle shroud can be used in conjunction with other muzzle devices (such as a muzzle brake, flash hider or a brake/hider hybrid device). This way the user can still benefit from some of the recoil reduction of a muzzle brake, but with less of the noise and concussion normally associated with such a device. However, depending on the design, the CRD will usually increase the recoil to some degree compared to using a muzzle brake only.

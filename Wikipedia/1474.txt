A hydrocopter is an amphibious propeller-driven catamaran with a boat-like hull, small wheels and pontoon skis (as in a seaplane). An aircraft engine with a propeller and air rudder powers the vehicle over water, ice, snow and land.Hydrocopters are used in Arctic coastal regions, primarily Sweden and Finland, during "menföre" (Swedish, bad going), or "kelirikko" (Finnish broken going) (see also Russian “rasputitsa"), when melting ice cannot support ground vehicles and boats are hindered as well. Hydrocopters are often used as a low-cost alternative to hovercraft and helicopters. Hydrocopters are primarily produced in small machine shops or made by hobbyists as hydrocopters have never been mass produced.

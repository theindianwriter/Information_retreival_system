In fluid dynamics, Rayleigh's equation or Rayleigh stability equation is a linear ordinary differential equation to study the hydrodynamic stability of a parallel, incompressible and inviscid shear flow. The equation is:

  
    
      
        (
        U
        −
        c
        )
        (
        
          φ
          ″
        
        −
        
          k
          
            2
          
        
        φ
        )
        −
        
          U

        φ
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle (U-c)(\varphi ''-k^{2}\varphi )-U''\varphi =0,}
  with 
  
    
      
        U
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle U(z)}
   the flow velocity of the steady base flow whose stability is to be studied and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   is the cross-stream direction (i.e. perpendicular to the flow direction). Further 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (z)}
   is the complex valued amplitude of the infinitesimal streamfunction perturbations applied to the base flow, 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is the wavenumber of the perturbations and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is the phase speed with which the perturbations propagate in the flow direction. The prime denotes differentiation with respect to 
  
    
      
        z
        .

In mathematics, the arithmetic–geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers x and y is defined as follows:
Call x and y a0 and g0:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  a
                  
                    0
                  
                
              
              
                
                =
                x
                ,
              
            
            
              
                
                  g
                  
                    0
                  
                
              
              
                
                =
                y
                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{0}&=x,\\g_{0}&=y.\end{aligned}}}
  Then define the two interdependent sequences (an) and (gn) as

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  a
                  
                    n
                    +
                    1
                  
                
              
              
                
                =
                
                  
                    
                      1
                      2
                    
                  
                
                (
                
                  a
                  
                    n
                  
                
                +
                
                  g
                  
                    n
                  
                
                )
                ,
              
            
            
              
                
                  g
                  
                    n
                    +
                    1
                  
                
              
              
                
                =
                
                  
                    
                      a
                      
                        n
                      
                    
                    
                      g
                      
                        n
                      
                    
                  
                
                
                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n+1}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a_{n}+g_{n}),\\g_{n+1}&={\sqrt {a_{n}g_{n}}}\,.\end{aligned}}}
  These two sequences converge to the same number, the arithmetic–geometric mean of x and y; it is denoted by M(x, y), or sometimes by agm(x, y).
The arithmetic–geometric mean is used in fast algorithms for exponential and trigonometric functions, as well as some mathematical constants, in particular, computing π.

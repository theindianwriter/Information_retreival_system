The laminar flamelet model is one of the methods of modelling turbulent combustions apart from SCRS, eddy flamelet model and others. Combustion is a very important thermochemical process with significant material and aerodynamic implications and thus CFD modeling of combustion has become indispensable. The laminar flamelet model is basically for non pre-mixed fuel (the system in which the fuel and oxygen is supplied from two different pipes). 
The concept of ensemble of laminar flamelets was first introduced by Forman A. Williams in 1975, while the theoretical foundation was developed by Norbert Peters in the early 80s.

This page describes some of the parameters used to characterize the thickness and shape of boundary layers formed by fluid flowing along a solid surface.  The defining characteristic of boundary layer flow is that at the solid walls, the fluid's velocity is reduced to zero.  The boundary layer refers to the thin transition layer between the wall and the bulk fluid flow.  The boundary layer concept was originally developed by Ludwig Prandtl  and is broadly classified into two types, bounded and unbounded.  Each of the main types has a laminar, transitional, and turbulent sub-type.  The two types of boundary layers use similar methods to describe the thickness and shape of the transition region with a couple of exceptions detailed in the Unbounded Boundary Layer Section. The characterizations detailed below consider steady flow but is easily extended to unsteady flow.

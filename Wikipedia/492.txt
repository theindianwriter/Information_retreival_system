Gas kinetics is a science in the branch of fluid dynamics, concerned with the study of motion of gases and its effects on physical systems.  Based on the principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, gas dynamics arises from the studies of gas flows in transonic and supersonic flights.  To distinguish itself from other sciences in fluid dynamics, the studies in gas dynamics are often defined with gases flowing around or within physical objects at speeds comparable to or exceed the speed of sound and causing a significant change in temperature and pressure.  Some examples of these studies include but are not limited to: choked flows in nozzles and valves, shock waves around jets, aerodynamic heating on atmospheric reentry vehicles and flows of gas fuel within a jet engine.  At the molecular level, gas dynamics is a study of the kinetic theory of gases, often leading to the study of gas diffusion, statistical mechanics, chemical thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  Gas dynamics is synonymous with aerodynamics when the gas field is air and the subject of study is flight.  It is highly relevant in the design of aircraft and spacecraft and their respective propulsion systems.

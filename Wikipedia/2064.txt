A highly accelerated life test (HALT) is a stress testing methodology for enhancing product reliability. HALT testing is currently in use by major manufacturing and research & development organizations to improve product reliability in a variety of industries, including electronics, computer, medical, and military.
HALT can be effectively used multiple times over a product's life time.  During product development, it can find design weakness when changes are much less costly to make. By finding weaknesses and making changes early, HALT can lower product development costs and compress time to market. When HALT is used at the time a product is being introduced into the market, it can expose problems caused by new manufacturing processes.  When used after a product has been introduced into the market, HALT can be used to audit product reliability caused by changes in components, manufacturing processes or suppliers etc.

Propeller walk (also known as propeller effect,  wheeling effect, paddle wheel effect, asymmetric thrust, asymmetric blade effect, transverse thrust, prop walk) is the term for a propeller's tendency to rotate about a vertical axis (also known as yaw motion). The rotation is in addition to the forward or backward acceleration.
Knowing of and understanding propeller walk is important when maneuvering in small spaces. It can be used to one's advantage while mooring off, or it can complicate a maneuver if the effect works against the pilot.

Fuck is a profane English-language word. It often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around AD 1475. In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut and fuck off.
Fuck is considered offensive and vulgar. In the United States, fuck is often removed from music broadcast over radio. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that usage of fuck is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments. Instances of public figures such as politicians using fuck often gain significant attention.

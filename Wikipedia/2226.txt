United States Army Futures Command (AFC) is a United States Army command aimed at modernizing the Army.  It currently focuses on six priorities: 1— long-range precision fires, 2— next-generation combat vehicle, 3— future vertical lift platforms, 4— a mobile & expeditionary Army network, 5— air & missile defense capabilities,  and 6— soldier lethality. AFC's cross-functional teams (CFTs) are Futures Command's vehicle for sustainable reform of the acquisition process for the future.Futures Command (AFC) was established in 2018 as a peer of FORSCOM, TRADOC, and Army Materiel Command (AMC), the other Army commands (ACOMs—providing forces, training and doctrine, and materiel respectively). The other Army commands focus on their readiness to "Fight tonight" when called upon by the nation. In contrast, AFC is focused on future readiness for competition with near-peers, who have updated their capabilities. The command is supported by United States Army Reserve Innovation Command (aka. 75th Innovation Command).AFC declared its full operational capability (FOC) in July 2019, after an initial one-year period. The FY2020 budget allocated $30 billion for the top six modernization priorities over the next five years. The $30 billion came from $8 billion in cost avoidance and $22 billion in terminations. Over 30 projects are envisioned to become the materiel basis needed for overmatching any potential competitors in the continuum of conflict over the next ten years, in multi-domain operations (MDO).

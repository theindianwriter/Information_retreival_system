The TGV (Train Ã  Grande Vitesse, French for "High-Speed Train") holds a series of land speed records for rail vehicles achieved  by SNCF, the French national railway, and its industrial partners.  The high-speed trials are intended to expand the limits of high-speed rail technology, increasing speed and comfort without compromising safety.
The current world speed record for a commercial train on steel wheels is held by the French TGV at 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph), achieved on 3 April 2007 on the new LGV Est.

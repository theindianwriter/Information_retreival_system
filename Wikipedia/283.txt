Flow measurement is  the quantification of bulk fluid movement.  Flow can be measured in a variety of ways. The common types of flowmeters with industrial applications are listed below:

a) Obstruction type (differential pressure or variable area)
b) Inferential (turbine type)
c) Electromagnetic
d) Positive-displacement flowmeters, which accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow.
e) Fluid dynamic (vortex shedding)
f) Anemometer
g) Ultrasonic
h) Mass flowmeter (Coriolis force).Flow measurement methods other than positive-displacement flowmeters rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area. For very large flows, tracer methods may be used to deduce the flow rate from the change in concentration of a dye or radioisotope.
